By turning in this assignment, I agree by the Stanford honor code and declare
that all of this is my own work.

\section*{Problem 1}

b) Add variables $X_j = 1$ through $m$ with a domain of an n-length array of Falses and an array $A$ of boolean values of length n such that $A[k] = True$ if $k \in T_j$. 
Let constraints $i = 1$ through $n$ be m-ary constraints that take in all m variables $X_j$ and return True if all $X_j[i]$s XORed together is True.

\section*{Problem 3}

e) It does produce a reasonable course schedule, but even with optimizations, it is quite slow.
