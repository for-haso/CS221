<p> What courses should you take in a given quarter?  Answering this question
requires balancing your interests, satisfying prerequisite chains, graduation
requirements, availability of courses; this can be a complex tedious process.
In this assignment, you will write a program that does automatic course
scheduling for you based on your preferences and constraints.
The program will cast the course scheduling problem (CSP) as a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) and then use backtracking search to solve that CSP
to give you your optimal course schedule.
</p>

<p>
We have already implemented a basic backtracking search for solving weighted CSPs.
First, in Problem 1, you will write three heuristics that will make CSP solving much
faster. In problem 2, you will add helper functions to generate more complex
constraint functions.
Lastly, in Problem 3, you will create the course scheduling CSP
and solve it using the code in Problem 1.
</p>

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: CSP solving</div>

<p>
We will be working with weighted CSPs,
which associates a weight for each assignment $x$ based on the product of $m$ potential functions $f_1, \dots, f_m$:
$$\text{Weight}(x) = \prod^m_{j=1}f_j(x)$$
where each potential $f_j(x)\geq 0$ (for unweighted CSP, $f_j(x)\in\{0,1\}$).
Our goal is to find the assignment(s) $x$ with the highest weight.
In this problem, we will assume that each potential is either a unary potential (depends on exactly one variable)
or a binary potential (depends on exactly two variables).
</p>

<p>
Recall that backtracking search operates over partial assignments
and associates each partial assignment with a weight, which is the product of all the potentials
that depend only on the assigned variables in $x$.
When we assign a value to a new variable $X_i$, we multiply in all the potentials
that depend only on $X_i$ and the previously assigned variables.
The function <code>get_delta_weight()</code> returns the contribution
of these new potentials based on the <code>unaryPotentials</code> and
<code>binaryPotentials</code>.
An important case is when <code>get_delta_weight()</code> returns 0.
In this case, any full assignment that extends the new partial assignment will also be zero,
so <i>there is no need to search further with that new partial assignment</i>.</p>
<p>
We have implemented a basic backtracking solver for you.  You can try it out in a
Python shell on the simple Australia map coloring problem (this is also provided
in <code>run_p1.py</code>):
<pre>
import util, submission
csp = util.create_map_coloring_csp()
alg = submission.BacktrackingSearch()
alg.solve(csp)
print alg.optimalAssignment # {'WA': 'green', 'Q': 'green', 'T': 'green', 'V': 'green', 'SA': 'red', 'NT': 'blue', 'NSW': 'blue'}
</pre>
Look at <code>BacktrackingSearch.reset_results()</code> to see the other fields which are set as a result of solving the weighted CSP.
You should read <code>util.CSP</code> and <code>submission.BacktrackingSearch</code> carefully to make
sure that you understand how the backtracking search is working on the CSP.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code">Let's create a CSP to solve the n-queens problem:
Given an $n\times n$ board, we'd like to
place $n$ queens on this board such that no two queens are on the same row,
column, or diagonal. Implement <code>create_nqueens_csp()</code> by adding
$n$ variables and some number of binary potentials. You can refer to the CSP
examples we provided in <code>util.py</code> for guidance.
You can also run the examples with
<code>run_p1.py</code>.
Note that the solver collects some basic
statistics on the performance of the algorithm. You should take advantage of
these statistics for debugging and analysis.
You should get 92 (optimal) assignments for
$n=8$ with exactly 2057 operations (number of calls to <code>backtrack()</code>).
Hint: If you get a larger number of operations, make sure your CSP is minimal.
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Let's create another CSP.
Suppose you have $n$ light bulbs, where each light bulb $i = 1, \dots, n$ is initially off.
You also have $m$ buttons which control the lights.
For each button $j = 1, \dots, m$, we know the subset $T_j \subset \{ 1, \dots,
n \}$ of light bulbs that it controls.
When button $j$ is pressed, it toggles the state of each light bulb in $T_j$
(if $3 \in T_j$ and light bulb 3 is off, then after the button is pressed,
light bulb 3 will be on, and vice versa).
Your goal is to turn on all the light bulbs by pressing a subset of the buttons.
Construct a CSP to solve this problem.
Your CSP should have $m$ variables and $n$ constraints.
Describe your CSP precisely and concisely.
</li>

<li class="code">
You might notice that our search algorithm explores quite a large number of states
even for the $8\times 8$ board. Let's see if we can do better.
One heuristic we talked about in class is most constrained variable (MCV):
To choose an unassigned variable, pick
the $X_j$ that has the fewest number of values $a$ which are consistent with the
current partial assignment (<code>get_delta_weight</code> on $X_j=a$ returns a non-zero value).

Implement this heuristic in
<code>get_unassigned_variable()</code> under the condition <code>self.mcv = True</code>.
You should observe a non-trivial reduction in the number of states explored.
</li>

<li class="code">
Another heuristic is least constraining value (LCV): Given
the next variable to be assigned $X_j$, sort its domain values $a$ in descending
order of the number of values $b$ of an unassigned variable $X_k$ that are consistent with $X_j = a$
(consistent means the binary potential on $X_j=a$ and $X_k=b$ is non-zero).
Note that you should count only values of $b$ which are already consistent with the existing partial assignment.
Implement this heuristic in
<code>get_ordered_values()</code> under the condition <code>self.lcv = True</code>.
Note that for this function, you will need to use <code>binaryPotentials</code> in
<code>CSP</code>.
</li>

<li class="code">
So far, our heuristics have only looked at the local effects of a variable or value.
Let's now implement arc consistency (AC-3) that we discussed in lecture.
After we set variable $X_j$ to value $a$, we
remove the values $b$ of all neighboring variables $X_k$ that could cause
arc-inconsistencies.
If $X_k$'s domain has changed, we use $X_k$'s domain to remove values from the domains of its neighboring variables.
This is repeated until no domains have changed.
Note that this may significantly reduce your branching factor, although at some cost.
Please fill in
<code>arc_consistency_check()</code> and <code>backtrack()</code>.
You might find <code>copy.deepcopy()</code> on <code>self.domains</code> useful.
You should make sure that your existing MCV and LCV
implementation are compatible with your AC-3 algorithm as we will be using all
three heuristics together during grading. You should observe a very significant
reduction in the number of steps taken to reach the first full assignment.
</li>

</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Handling $n$-ary potentials</div>
So far, our CSPs only handle unary and binary potentials,
but for course scheduling, we need potentials that involve more than two variables.
In this problem, you will take two types of $n$-ary constraints
and reduce them to a set of binary potentials with auxiliary variables.
<ol class="problem">
<li class="code">
Implement <code>get_or_variable()</code>,
which takes in a sequence of variables and a target value, and it returns a boolean variable with domain <code>[True, False]</code> whose value is
constrainted to the condition of having at least one of the variables assigned to the target value.
To do this, you need to add auxiliary variables and potentials to enforce these constraints.
For example, suppose you wanted to enforce the disjunctive (OR) constraint on a
set of boolean variables, $[(X_1==True) \vee (X_2==True) \vee (X_3==True) = X_4]$.
We would call <code>get_or_variable()</code> on $(X_1,X_2,X_3,True)$ to get some auxiliary
variable $Y$, and then add another constraint $[Y = X_4]$.
Please refer to the comments for implementation details.
</li>
<li class="code">
Implement <code>get_sum_variable()</code>,
which takes in a sequence of non-negative integer-valued variables
and returns a variable whose value is constrained to equal the sum of the variables.
You will need to access the domains of the variables passed in,
which you can assume contain only non-negative integers.
For example, suppose you wanted to enforce the constraint $[X_1 + X_2 + X_3 \le X_4]$.
We would call <code>get_sum_variable()</code> on $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ to get some auxiliary
variable $Y$, and then add another constraint $[Y \le X_4]$.
Please refer to the comments for implementation details.
</li>
</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Course Scheduling</div>

<p>
In this problem, we will apply your weighted CSP solver to the problem of course
scheduling.
We have scraped a subset of courses that are offered this year from Stanford's
Bulletin. For each course in this dataset,
we have information on which quarters it is offered,
the prerequisites (which may not be fully accurate due to
ambiguity in the listing), and the range of units allowed.
You can take a look at all the courses in <code>courses.json</code>.
Please refer to
<code>util.Course</code> and <code>util.CourseBulletin</code> for more information.
</p>
<p>
To specify a desired course plan, you would need to provide a <i>profile</i>
which specifies your constraints and preferences for courses.
A profile is specified in a text file (see <code>profile*.txt</code> for examples).
The profile file has four sections.
The first section specifies a fixed minimum and maximum
(inclusive) number of units you need to take for each quarter. In the
second section, you <code>register</code> for the quarters that you want
to take your courses in.  For example, <code>register Aut2013</code> would sign you up for
this quarter. The quarters need not to be contiguous, but they must follow the
exact format <code>XxxNNNN</code>.
The third section specifies the list of courses that you've taken in the
past and elsewhere using the <code>taken</code> keyword.
The the last section
is a list of courses that you would like to take during the registered quarters,
specified using <code>request</code>. Not every course listed in
<code>request</code> must appear in the generated schedule. Conversely, a list of
requests could potentially result in an infeasible schedule due to the
additional constraints we will discuss next.
</p>
To allow for more flexibility in your preferences,
we allow some freedom to customize the requests.
For instance, if you only want to take exclusively one of several
courses but not sure which one, then specify:
<pre>request CS229 or CS229A or CS229T</pre>
Note that these courses do not necessarily have to be offered in the same
quarter. The final schedule can have at most one of these three courses. <b>Each
course can only be requested at most once.</b>
</p>
<p>
If you want to take a course in one of a specified set of quarters, use the
<code>in</code> modifier.
For example, if you want to take one of CS221 or CS229 in either Aut2013 <b>or</b> Sum2016, do:
<pre>request CS221 or CS229 in Aut2013,Sum2016</pre>
Another operator you can apply is <code>after</code>, which specifies
that a course must be taken after another one.
For example, if you want to choose one of CS221 or CS229 and take it after both CS109 <b>and</b> CS161, add:
<pre>request CS221 or CS229 after CS109,CS161</pre>
Note that this implies that if you take CS221 or CS229, then you must take both CS109 and CS161.
In this case, we say that CS109 and CS161 are <code>prereqs</code> of this request.
(Note that there's no space after the comma.)
For your convenience, if you request
course A and B (separately), and A is a prerequisite of B (based on <code>CourseBulletin</code>),
we will automatically add A as a prerequisite for B; that is,
typing <code>request B</code> is converted to <code>request B after A</code>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the last operator you can add is <code>weight</code>, which adds
non-negative weight to each request. All requests have a default weight value of 1.
Requests with higher weight should be preferred by your
CSP solver. Note that you can combine all of the aforementioned operators into
one as follows
<pre>request CS221 or CS229 in Win2014,Win2015 after CS131 weight 5</pre>
<p>
It's important to note that a request does not have to be active, but if it is,
the constraints specified by the various operators <code>after,in</code> must be satisfied.
</p>
<p>
We have done all the parsing of the bulletin and profile for you,
so all you need to work with is the collection of <code>Request</code>
objects in <code>Profile</code> and <code>CourseBulletin</code>
to know when courses are offered and the number of units of courses.
Your task is to take a profile and bulletin and construct a CSP.
We have started you off with code in <code>SchedulingCSPConstructor</code>
that constructs the core variables of the CSP as well as some basic constraints.
The variables are all pairs of requests and registered quarters <code>(request, quarter)</code>,
and the value of such a variable is one of the course IDs in that Request
or <code>None</code>, which indicates none of the courses should be taken in that
quarter. We will add auxiliary variables later.
We have also implemented some basic constraints:
<code>add_bulletin_constraints()</code>, which enforces that a course can only be
taken if it's offered in that quarter (according to the bulletin), and
<code>add_norepeating_contstraints()</code>,
which constrains that no course can be taken more than once.</p>
<ol class="problem">

<li class="code">
Implement the <code>add_quarter_constraints()</code>. This is when your
profile specifies which quarter(s) you want your requested courses to be taken in.
This does not saying that one of the courses must be taken,
but if it is, then it must be taken in any one of the specified quarters.
Also note that this constraint will apply to all courses in that request.
We have written a <code>verify_schedule()</code>
function in <code>grader.py</code> that determines if your schedule satisfies all
of the given constraints. Note that since we are not dealing with units yet, it
will print <code>None</code> for the number of units of each course.
</li>
<li class="code">
Let's add the weight potential in
<code>add_request_weights()</code>.  By default, all requests have a weight of 1
regardless whether it's satisfied or not. When a weight is explicitly specified,
it should only contribute to the final
weight if one of the requested courses is in the solution.
<b>NOTE:</b> Each grader test only tests the function you are asked to
implement. To test your CSP with multiple constraints you can use
<code>run_p3.py</code> and changing the constraints that you want to add.
</li>
<li class="code">
Implement the <code>add_prereq_constraints()</code> function. You can assume
that the courses in <code>request.prereqs</code> are all requested. You must
make sure that if a course is taken in some quarter, its prerequisites must all
be taken before that quarter. You should use <code>get_or_variable()</code>.
</li>
<li class="code">
Let's now add the unit constraints in <code>add_unit_constraints()</code>.
You must ensure that the sum of units per quarter for your schedule are within
the min and max threshold inclusive.
You should use <code>get_sum_variable()</code>.
In order for our solution extractor to
obtain the number of units, for every course,
you must add a variable <code>(courseId, quarter)</code>
to the CSP taking on a value equal to the number of units being taken for that
course during that quarter. When the course is not taken during that quarter,
the unit should be 0.
</li>
<li class="writeup">
Now try to use the course scheduler for the winter and spring (and next year if applicable).
Create your own <code>profile.txt</code> and then run the course scheduler:
<pre>
python run_p3.py profile.txt
</pre>
You might want to turn on the appropriate heuristic flags to speed up the
computation. Does it produce a reasonable course schedule?
Please submit your <code>profile.txt</code>; we're curious how it worked out for you!
