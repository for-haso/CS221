This assignment is a modified version of the <a
  href="http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.html">Driverless
  Car</a> assignment written by Chris Piech.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://en.mercopress.com/2013/03/18/in-2010-there-were-1.24-million-road-traffic-related-deaths-worldwide-says-who-report">study</a>
by the World Health Organisation found that road accidents kill a shocking 1.24
million people a year worldwide.
In response, there has been great interest in 
developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car">autonomous driving technology</a>
that can can drive with calculated precision and reduce this death
toll.
Building an autonomous driving system is an incredibly complex endeavor.  Therefore,
in this assignment, you will focus on the sensing system, which allows
us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Getting started.</b>
Let's start by trying to drive manually:
<pre>python drive.py -l lombard -i none</pre>
<p>You can steer by either using the arrow keys or 'w', 'a', and 'd'.
The up key and 'w' accelerates your car forward, the left
key and 'a' turns the steering wheel to the left,
and the right key and 'd' turns the steering wheel to the right.
Note that you cannot reverse the car or turn in place.
 Quit by pressing 'q'.
Your goal is to drive from the start to finish (the green box) without getting
in an accident. How well can you do on crooked Lombard street without knowing
the location of other cars?  Don't worry if you aren't very good; the staff was
only able to get to the finish line 4/10 times.  This 60% accident rate
is pretty abysmal, which is why we're going to build an AI to do this.
</p>

<p>Flags for <code>python drive.py</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-a</code>: Enable autonomous driving (as opposed to manual).</li>
  <li><code>-i &lt;inference method&gt;</code>: Use <code>none</code>, <code>exactInference</code>, <code>particleFilter</code> to (approximately) compute the belief distributions.</li>
  <li><code>-l &lt;map&gt;</code>: Use this map (e.g. <code>small</code> or <code>lombard</code>)</li>
  <li><code>-d</code>: Debug by showing all the cars on the map.</li>
  <li><code>-p</code>: All other cars remain parked (so that they don't move).</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
<b>Modeling car locations.</b>
We assume that the world is a two-dimensional rectangular grid
on which your car and $K$ other cars reside.
At each time step $t$, your car gets a noisy estimate
of the distance to each of the cars.  As a simplifying assumption, we
assume that each of the $K$ other cars moves independently and
that the sensor reading for each car is also independent.
Therefore, in the following, we will reason about each car independently
(notationally, we will assume there is just one other car).
</p>

<p>
At each time step $t$, let $c_t \in \mathbb R^2$
be a pair of coordinates representing the actual location of
the other car (which is unobserved).
We assume there is a probability distribution $p(c_t \mid c_{t-1})$ which
governs the other car's movement.
Let $a_t \in \mathbb R^2$ be your car's position,
which you observe and also control.
To minimize costs, we use a simple sensing system based on a microphone.
Specifically, the microphone provides us with $d_t$,
which is a Gaussian random variable with mean equal
to the distance between your car and the other car
and variance $\sigma^2$ (in the code, $\sigma$ is <code>Const.SONAR_STD</code>, which
is about two-thirds the length of a car). 
In symbols, <center>$d_t \sim \mathcal N(\|a_t - c_t\|, \sigma^2)$.</center>

For example, if your car is at $a_t = (1,3)$ and the other car is 
at $(4,7)$, then the actual distance is $5$ and $d_t$ might be $4.6$ or $5.2$, etc.
Use <code>util.pdf(mean, std, value)</code> to compute the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density function (PDF)</a>
of a Gaussian with given mean and standard deviation, evaluated at <code>value</code>.
Note that the PDF does not return a probability (densities can exceed $1$),
but for the purposes of this assignment, you can get away with treating it like a probability.

</p></center>

<p>
Your job is to implement a car tracker that (approximately) computes the posterior
distribution $p(c_t \mid d_1, \dots, d_t)$ (your beliefs of where the other
car is) and update it for each $t = 1, 2, \dots$.  We will take care
of using this information to actual drive the car (set $a_t$ as to avoid
collision with $c_t$), so you don't have to worry about this part.
</p>

<p>
To simplify things, we will discretize the world into <b>tiles</b>, 2-tuples $(r,c)$ for
integers $0 \le r &lt; \text{numRows}$ and $0 \le c &lt; \text{numCols}$,
and store a probability for each tile $(r,c)$ (in code, this is <code>self.belief.getProb(r, c)</code>).
To convert from a tile $(r,c)$ to a location value,
use <code>util.rowToY(r)</code> and <code>util.colToX(c)</code>.

In Problems 1 and 2, you will implement <code>ExactInference</code>,
which computes a full distribution over tiles $(r,c)$.
In Problem 3, you will implement <code>ParticleFilter</code>,
which works with particle-based represention of this distribution.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Emission probabilities (5 points)</div>

<p>
In this part, we assume that the other car is stationary (e.g., $c_t = c_{t-1}$ for all time steps $t$).
You will implement a function <code>observe</code> that takes
the current posterior probability $p(c_t \mid d_1, \dots,
d_{t-1})$ (<code>self.beliefs</code> in <code>ExactInference</code>),
a new observation $d_t$,
and sets <code>self.beliefs</code> to
$$p(c_t \mid d_1, \dots, d_t) \propto p(d_t \mid c_t) p(c_t \mid d_1, \dots, d_{t-1}).$$

</p></center>

<ol class="problem">
<li class="code">Fill in the <code>observe</code> method in
the <code>ExactInference</code> class of <code>exactInference.py</code>.
This method should update the posterior probability of each tile given the observed noisy distance.
After you're done, you should be able to find the stationary
car by driving around it (<code>-p</code> means cars don't move):</li>
</ol>
<pre>python drive.py -a -p -d -k 1 -i exactInference</pre>
<p>
You can turn off <code>-a</code> to manually drive.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Transition probabilities (5 points)</div>

<p>Now, let's consider the case where the other car is moving
according to transition probabilities $p(c_t \mid c_{t-1})$.
We have provided the transition probabilities for you in <code>self.transProb</code>.
Specifically, 
<code>self.transProb[(oldTile, newTile)]</code> is the probability of the other car 
being in <code>newTile</code> at time step $t$ given that it was in <code>oldTile</code> at time step $t-1$.
</p>

<p>
In this part, you will implement a function <code>elapseTime</code> that takes
the posterior probability of the previous time step $p(c_{t-1} \mid d_1, \dots,
d_{t-1})$ (<code>self.belief</code> in <code>ExactInference</code>),
and sets <code>self.belief</code> to
$$p(c_t \mid d_1, \dots, d_{t-1}) \propto p(c_t \mid c_{t-1}) p(c_{t-1} \mid d_1, \dots, d_{t-1}).$$
</p>

<ol class="problem">
<li class="code">Finish <code>ExactInference</code> by implementing the
<code>elapseTime</code> method.
When you are all done, you should be able to
track a moving car well enough to drive autonomously:</li>
<pre>python drive.py -a -d -k 1 -i exactInference</pre>
</ol>

You can also drive autonomously in the presence of more than one car:
<pre>python drive.py -a -d -k 3 -i exactInference</pre>
and even down Lombard:
<pre>python drive.py -a -d -k 3 -i exactInference -l lombard</pre>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Particle filtering (15 points)</div>

<p>
Though exact inference works well for the small maps, it wastes a lot of effort
computing probabilities for cars being unlikely tiles.
We can solve this problem using a
particle filter which has complexity linear in the number of particles
rather than linear in the number of tiles.
Implement all necessary methods for the <code>ParticleFilter</code>
class in <code>particleFilter.py</code>. When complete, you should be
able to track cars nearly as effectively as with exact inference.
</p>

<ol class="problem">
<li class="code">Much of the code has been provided for you. Particles have
been initialized randomly and the beliefs are automatically updated after you
resample the particles. You just need to fill in the <code>observe</code>,
<code>resample</code>, and <code>elapseTime</code> functions,
which should modify <code>self.particles</code>, which is a map from tiles $(r,c)$ to the
number of times that particle occurs.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
You should use the same transition probabilities as in exact inference.
The belief distribution generated by a particle filter is expected to look
noisier compared to the one obtained exact inference.
<pre>python drive.py -a -i particleFilter -l lombard</pre>
To debug, you might want to start with the parked car flag
(<code>-p</code>) and the display car flag (<code>-d</code>).
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 4: Which car is it? (15 points)</div>

<p>
So far, we have assumed that we have a distinct noisy distance reading for each car, but in
reality, our microphone would just pick up an undistinguished set of these signals, and we
wouldn't know which distance reading corresponds to which car.
First, let's extend the notation from before: let $c_{ti} \in \mathbb R^2$ be the location
of the $i$-th car at the time step $t$, for $i = 1, \dots, K$ and $t = 1, \dots, T$.
</p>
<p>
Let $d_{ti} \in \mathbb R$ be the noisy distance measurement of the $i$-th car,
which is now not observed.  Instead, we observe the set of distances
$e_t = \{ d_{t1}, \dots, d_{tK} \}$ (assume that all distances are all distinct).
Alternatively, you can think of $e_t = (e_{t1}, \dots, e_{tK})$ as a list
which is a random permutation of the noisy distances $(d_{t1}, \dots, d_{tK})$.
For example, suppose $K=2$ and $T = 2$.
Before, we might have gotten distance readings of $1$ and $2$ for the first car and
$3$ and $4$ for the second car.
Now, our readings would be permutations of $\{1, 3\}$ and $\{2, 4\}$.
Thus, even if we knew the second car was distance $3$ away in $t = 1$,
we wouldn't know if it moved farther ($4$ away) or closer ($2$ away) in $t = 2$.
</p>

<ol class="problem">
    <li class="writeup">
    Suppose we have $K=2$ cars and one time step $T=1$.
    Write an expression for the conditional distribution $p(c_{11}, c_{12} \mid e_1)$
    as a function of the PDF of a Gaussian $\mathcal p_{\mathcal N}(v; \mu, \sigma^2)$
    and the prior probability $p(c_{1i})$ over car locations.
    Hint: for $K=1$, the answer would be $$p(c_{11} \mid e_1) \propto p(c_{11}) p_{\mathcal N}(e_{11}; \|a_1 - c_{11}\|, \sigma^2).$$
    where $a_t$ is the position of the car at time t.
    You might find it useful to draw the Bayesian network and think about the distribution of $e_t$
    given $d_{t1}, \dots, d_{tK}$.
    </li>
    <li class="writeup">
    Assuming the prior $p(c_{1i})$ is the same for all $i$,
    show that the number of car locations $(c_{11}, \dots, c_{1K})$ that obtain the maximum value of
    $p(c_{11}, \dots, c_{1K} \mid e_1)$ is at least $K!$.
    </li>
    <li class="writeup">
    For general $K$, what is the treewidth corresponding to the posterior distribution
    over all $K$ car locations at all $T$ time steps given all the data.
    $p(c_{11}, \dots, c_{1K}, \dots, c_{T1}, \dots, c_{TK} \mid e_1, \dots, e_T)$? Explain why.
