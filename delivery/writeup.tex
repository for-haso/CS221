By turning in this assignment, I agree by the Stanford honor code and declare
that all of this is my own work.

\section*{Problem 1}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item See code.
  \item See code.
  \item state = (location, packages_held, num_packages_picked_up)\\
  start = (start_loc, {}, 0)\\
  goal = (same as start, {}, k)\\
  actions = move north, south, east, west (change loc), pick up package (packages held added new package, increment num_packages_picked_up; only available at P_i), drop off package (package removed; only available at D_i if package picked up)\\
  costs = move: 1 + size(package_set); pick up/drop off = 0
  \\ For P_i and D_i, need to store bool to indicate package vs. not package (true = has package, false = not has package)
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 2}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item (your solution)
  \item (your solution)
